            <p> Hi! My name is Chelsey Tang and I am currently an undergraduate freshman studying Architecture at NJIT's Hillier College of Art and Design. I am from Fanwood, New Jersey, and recently graduated from Magnet High School, part of the Union County Vocational-Technical Schools district. I hope to combine the previous engineering knowledge I've accumulated from high school with my passion for art to create works that can convey the emotions and sensations I cannot put into words. 
                <br> </br>
                <br> Outside of the classroom and studio, I love to spend time outside with my friends and snowboard with my family in the winter. I also enjoy listening to various genres of music and playing video games. 
            
                <br> </br>
                Here is the 
                <a href="https://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/architecture-design/architecture/barch/"> NJIT Website </a>
                that describes the curriculum for the five years I will be spending here.
